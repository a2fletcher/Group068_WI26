    "Since the rise of AI, online discussion forums (i.e., Reddit, Twitter) have seen an increase in bots that mimic or imitate human social interactions, particularly participating in conversations and discourse of various topics in the comment sections of threads. This mimicry blurs the line between human-generated internet discussion versus AI bot-generated discussion, and what is real versus what is fake. This raises the question: To what extent can bot-generated and human-generated Reddit comments be distinguished using predefined linguistic features (e.g., wording, syntax) and behavioral features (e.g., posting and response frequency)? \n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research has already been done regarding this topic, for example, the world’s largest Turing test study from AI lab AI21, involving 1.5 million human participants, where humans are tasked with discerning whether the user they’re chatting with was human or AI, correctly guessed that they were interacting with AI in “60% of conversations.” A statistic that researchers claimed was “not much higher than chance.”<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Alongside AI21’s test study, different research publications have noted that in subreddits, human user posts contained distinct features such as grammatical discrepancies, utilized internet jargon, and erroneous capitalization, for example, whilst ChatGPT-4 generated texts contained impeccable grammar, a complex syntactical structure, and overused emojis.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) This leads to a possible method of distinguishing an AI from human users, finding the difference of “lexical richness” and “logical soundness” between LLM-authored posts compared to human ones.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) \n",

    "We hypothesize that __bot-generated Reddit comments are distinguishable from human-generated comments__ as they exhibit systematic differences in *linguistic and behavioral patterns*. We assume that these differences are measurable using predefined quantities, with bots tending to exhibit more repetitive syntax, distinct wording patterns, higher posting frequency, and shorter response latency compared to humans. \n",
    "\n",
    "This prediction is based on prior research implying that artificial intelligence (AI) often displays systematic linguistic features and temporal behaviors that differ from humans, who tend to produce more variable language, including grammatical discrepancies and slang, and irregular posting patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we predict a strong correlation between the type of author (bot vs human) and their commenting habits on Reddit."
