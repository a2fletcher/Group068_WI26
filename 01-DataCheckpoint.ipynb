    "Since the rise of AI, online discussion forums (i.e., Reddit, Twitter) have seen an increase in bots that mimic or imitate human social interactions, particularly participating in conversations and discourse of various topics in the comment sections of threads. Such mimicry blurs the line between human-generated internet discussion versus AI bot-generated discussion, and what is real versus what is fake. This raises the question: To what extent can bot-generated and human-generated Reddit comments be distinguished using predefined linguistic features (e.g., wording, syntax) and behavioral features (e.g., posting and response frequency)? \n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research has already been done regarding this topic; for example, the world’s largest Turing test study from AI lab AI21, involving 1.5 million human participants, tasked humans with discerning whether the user they’re chatting with was human or AI. This resulted in correct guesses that they were interacting with AI in “60% of conversations,” a statistic that researchers claimed was “not much higher than chance.”<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Alongside AI21’s test study, different research publications have noted that in subreddits, human user posts contained distinct features such as grammatical discrepancies, internet jargon, and erroneous capitalization, whilst ChatGPT-4 generated texts contained impeccable grammar, a complex syntactical structure, and overused emojis.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) This leads to a possible method of distinguishing an AI from human users: finding the difference of “lexical richness” and “logical soundness” between LLM-authored posts compared to human ones.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) \n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
